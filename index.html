            <p>I am in Group 2 for this module. The main idea for this project is for an employee 
                to clock into work without needing to clock in manually.
                It would include a keycard that will be automatically scanned as the employee walks past the
                detector. There will be a facial recognition system as a failsafe. This also can function as 
                an automatic payroll calculator, and can also double as a security system to detect who walks in and
                out of the building. Initially I thought of something similar to the anti-theft systems that shops have.
                However, it isnt possible due to the fact that we need the big scanner, and it would be out of budget. 
                This week was mainly used for research. Python would be the main programming language used for this project.</p>

            <h5>Week 2</h5>
            <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>
            <p>This week, we first started off with making a rough UML diagram on how each component is connected to what.(refer to the image)
                As seem from the image, there will be a core component and a few sub components on how the entire system is going to work. Reader
                scans the keycard, passes data to Raspberry Pi, Raspberry Pi stores data in MSSQL. Raspberry Pi also connects to a speaker that 
                announce the name of the employee clocking in. As can be seen from the diagram, a camera will also be used in tandam with the scanner.
                It will make use of facial recognition to scan the employees walking in. This part is less refined as we are not sure if the RaspberryPi 
                can handle the machine learning for the facial recognition. That is all for this week. (also inception deck xd)
